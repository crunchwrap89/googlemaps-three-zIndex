# googlemaps-three-zIndex


This application adds a 3d box to the scene and it also sets bordercolors and fillColor to the map via geojson data.
The purpose of this app is to showcase that the threejsoverlayview will always have a zIndex lower than other overlays, so objects placed on the map will be below other shapes placed on the map.
